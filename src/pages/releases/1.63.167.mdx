#### Feature Updates

- 🚀 **Swipe Actions on Tasks**
  - Sometimes a swipe just feels better than tapping a checkbox - Try swiping right on a task to complete it!
  - Ever realized that you forgot to check off a recurring task that you completed the day before? Try swiping even further to the right to mark the task as completed yesterday. The next instance of the task will be planned accordingly.
  - You can now make common plan changes to tasks by swiping left! The suggested plans will get more flexible and more distant as you swipe futher to the left.

#### Bug Fixes

- 🐞 Fixed a compatibility issue in the Superbar with old browser versions.
- 🐞 Markdown link conversion improvements:
  - Fixed markdown link titles for URLs with custom schemes.
  - Improved conversion triggering when text is replaced with a copy-paste.
