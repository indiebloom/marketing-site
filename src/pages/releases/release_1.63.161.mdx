## Feature Updates

- **Promoting Todoist import and removing Outlook and Google Keep import**

  Our Outlook and Google Keep import experiences were thrown together in the early days of the app as a better-than-nothing starting point, but they don't meet our UX standards for the upcoming public release of the app. Meanwhile, the Todoist import experience was greatly enhanced last release, so we're making that option more prominent in the Settings page.


- **More control over tips**

  You can now toggle Aster tips on and off for each category of tips independently on the Settings page.
